# <3aesic-cyber> Image LSB Steganography

A python3 tool to encode and decode images and strings in the least significant bits (LSB) of an image.

## IMAGE IN IMAGE Encoding
    - Takes 2 images of the same size (resolution).
    - Hides one in the specified LSBs of the other.
    - Allows for different number of bits to be encoded. Best results with 2.

## IMAGE IN IMAGE Decoding
    - Takes an image and decodes using specified number of bits.

## TEXT IN IMAGE Encoding/Decoding

    Under construction.

## Libraries

Pillow

```bash
sudo pip install Pillow
```
or
```bash
sudo pip3 install Pillow
```

## Notes

Currently only IMAGE IN IMAGE section is working.
TEXT IN IMAGE section is being developed.

Thanks,
